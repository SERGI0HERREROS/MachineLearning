## üéØ Problem description
Disinformation is a hazardous and far-reaching phenomenon, capable of
causing profound changes in any community‚Äôs political, economic, and
cultural framework and thus undermining the foundations of societies around
the world, either intentionally or through unconscious mistakes. There is no
consensus for a standard definition of this phenomenon involving untruthful
information. In the Anglo-Saxon world, the most acknowledged classification
is the one proposed in Wardle & Derakhshan in 2017, which divides the
alteration or manipulation of information into three typologies:
- **Misinformation**: information that is false or misleading but not intended
to cause harm.
- **Disinformation**: malicious false information, i.e., with a motivation to
cause harm.
- **Malinformation**: information that is truthful but disseminated with the
aim of causing damage.

## üö© Labels
There are two target variables:
- **real** - Whether the tweet is real
- **fake** - Whether the tweet is fale

It is not going to be relevant when applying BERTopic (labels not consdiered in clustering (unsupervised learning).
