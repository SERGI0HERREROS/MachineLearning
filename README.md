## üéØ Problem description
The goal of this project is to predict the probability that people receive two types of vaccines:
- H1N1 flu vaccine.
- Seasonal flu vaccine.

All the information is on the following site:<br>
https://www.drivendata.org/competitions/66/flu-shot-learning/page/210/
<br><br>



## üö© Labels
There are two target variables:
- **h1n1_vaccine** - Whether respondent received H1N1 flu vaccine.
- **seasonal_vaccine** - Whether respondent received seasonal flu vaccine.

Both are binary variables: 0 = No; 1 = Yes.
<br><br>
